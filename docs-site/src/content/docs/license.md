description: MCP Front licensing terms
---

MCP Front is licensed under the [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/stainless-api/mcp-front/blob/main/LICENSE) with commercial exceptions.

## What you can do

Run MCP Front on your own infrastructure. Modify the source code to fit your needs. Use it for commercial purposes within your organization. Integrate it into your internal tooling. Use it as infrastructure for your own products or services, including commercial and public-facing services.

## What you cannot do

Offer MCP Front itself as a hosted or managed product to third parties. For example, you cannot run "MCP Front as a Service" and sell access to it. Using MCP Front as auth infrastructure for your own MCP servers is fine, even if those servers are public or commercial.

## Commercial exceptions

Stainless Software Ltd (stainless.com) and Samuel "dgellow" El-Borai (sam@elborai.me) have full commercial rights without the restrictions above.

## Why this license

The Elastic License protects against cloud providers offering the software as a competing service while keeping the source available for self-hosting and modification. This balances openness with sustainability.

## Full license text

The complete license is in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/stainless-api/mcp-front/blob/main/LICENSE) file in the repository.
